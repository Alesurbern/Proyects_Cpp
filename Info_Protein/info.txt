The idea of this program is to provide information about a protein sequence introduced
as a query.

Version 0.1
-X- Ask for an amino acid sequence in 1 letter format.
- - Show the information and finish the program.

-X- Make a structure to host each amino acid information. 
-X- Name of the amino acid.
-X- Molecular weight.
-X- Three letter name.
-X- One letter name.

-X- Added developer argument for extra functions.
- - Add a function for adding aminoacids.

- - Save all amino acid data into a file.
- - Load amino acid information at the beginning of the program.

- - Count the ocurrence of each amino acid.
- - Show the total number of amino acids.
- - Show the total ocurrence for each amino acid and the relative presence in
    the sequence.

Version 0.2
- - Check there are no strange or non codified letters.
- - Save an history of inputed sequences.
- - Calculate de extinction coeficient of the sequence.
        The extinction coeficient is calculated based in the sum of the amino acids
        that contribute to the absorbance at 280 nm. The exctinction coeficient for this pure amino acids
        is calculated using the Lamber-Beer formula. The extinction coefficient of this amino acids are:
        - Tryptophan: 5500 M-1*cm-1.
        - Tyrosin: 1490 M-1*cm-1.
        - Cisteine: 125 M-1*cm-1 (Just if there are disulfure bonds).

        The extinction coeficient for a protein uses the next sum:
        epsilon_280nm = (nTrp * 5500) + (nTyr * 1490) + (nCys * 125)
